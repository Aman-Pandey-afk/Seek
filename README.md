# Seek
A stealth game, built for learning gamedev using UnityEngine. (*Credits - Sebastian Lague Youtube*)_
The player has to reach checkpoint keeping safe from the guard light._ 
Have added some of my own features, like showing time taken to reach checkpoint and will be adding more in the future (like FPP mode and obstacles changing position on each level load)_
